## GAMEPLAY
You've opened up your very first pizza restaurant and are preparing your orders to be delivered. Everything was going well until the Vampire Pizzas smelled your delicious pizza sauce and are trying to attach your shop! You have to defend them off using whatever items available and hopefully you don't disappoint your customers too much. 

## Controls
Use your mouse and click on the traps you've acquired to stop those pesky vampires! 
**Wooden Pizza Cutter:** It'll damage the vampire pizzas.
**Garlic:** It'll slow down the vampire pizzas.
**Pepperoni:** This will help you earn pizza bucks faster to purchase more traps.
